NOTE: all previous earlyHalt files were from files incorrectly coded! 
The initial weights were being assigned incorrectly

earlyHalt: prevents excessive updating of weights after intial selectivity (sevond stim) says 'novel!
     NOTE: weird thing happening in which peak activations are currently decreasing. not sure why...

nosieOnFamil: more akin to classic signal detection theory in which there is a distribution of foil and target

FOLDER INFORMATION

vd_task1 -> models Barnese et. al expt 1, in which performance drops in
            the second half of trials for the lesioned network, HA only
        CURRENTLy -> parameters work, but only when 5 networks are modelled at once
			->->error bars are too small when running more rats

vd_task2 -> to model Barnese et. al expt2, in which performance is fine for the 
		first third of trials (uses pictures as well as abstract shapes, LA, 16 stims)
		drops in the second third (HA, abstract shapes only, 6 stims)
		rises again in the final third (HA again, 16 stims)
